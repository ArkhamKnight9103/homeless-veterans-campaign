				<h2 class="item">Our Purpose</h2>
				<p class="item">&emsp;Our organization is here to promote awareness for homeless veterans and their families that struggle with everyday life when they come home. Many veterans come back with missing limbs, PTSD, and other disabilities that makes finding jobs and being apart of a community difficult. We hope to bring awareness and get more people involved in helping those who fought for our freedom. Donating to various charities that focus on rehabilitating veterans to become productive members of society is a great way that you can help, but money is not the only way to help those in need. You can donate old clothes, canned foods, and other necessities that you may have no use for anymore. Simply spreading awareness by participating in events that are held by these charities is a great way to get involved in the movement by donating your time. These great men and women fought for our country to protect our rights and privileges, but are rewarded by coming home to a family in debt and struggling to put food on the table. When we need them the most they were there for us, so it's only right that we stand by them in their time of need.
